In this [post](https://lucio-cornejo.github.io/post/a-glimpse-into-the-world-of-voice-leading/)
you'll find a basic explanation of the mathematical problem I plan to solve
as my undergraduate's thesis project, besides its connection to music.

After giving that post a read, I invite you to play around with the musical functions
defined in such article, via these web apps I've created:

+ <https://lucio-cornejo.shinyapps.io/Unidirectional_minimal_voice_leading_graph>

+ <https://lucio-cornejo.shinyapps.io/MVL_and_CMD>

A quick summary of my mathemusical research is to find conditions, either 
necessary or sufficient, for when, given a **chord** and some **transposition** of it,
does there exist a **minimal voice leading** between such chords such that
all the **trajectories** which define such voice leading have the **same direction**,
that is, all downward or all upward trajectories.
