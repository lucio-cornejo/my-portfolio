[Pluto.jl](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl) is a notebook
environment for the [Julia](https://julialang.org/) programming
language. 

Despite **Pluto** having some of the best features of 
**Jupyter notebooks** and **Observable**, working with
**Pluto** greatly constrains the user with respect to the
keyboard shortcuts that can be used.

Such [issue](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl/issues/65)
has not been a priority for the developers of the **Pluto**
package. Therefore, I've implemented many of the 
features requested by the **Julia** community in the issue page above.
